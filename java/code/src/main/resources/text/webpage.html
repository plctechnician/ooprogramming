    <h2>Getting WebbIE</h2>
    <p>WebbIE is free. You can get it from the link below. You have to run
        the setup.exe file that you get from the link, and everything will be
        installed for you. You will then have a desktop shortcut called "WebbIE"
        you can use to start the program. You can also find "WebbIE" in your
        Start menu.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.webbie.org.uk/webbrowser/setup.exe">Installer
            for WebbIE Web Browser 4</a>
            Run this setup.exe file to install WebbIE Web Browser. Note that if
            you
            have installed the Beta already (before 6 January 2013) you will
            have
            to uninstall this first from Add/Remove Programs - sorry.

        </li>

            and scattered around the page, so you can get on with reading the

            content without having to spend time finding it.

        <li>Access and add to your <strong>Internet Explorer Favorites.</strong>

            visibility schemes for maximum readability.
        </li>

            chance of working.
        </li>

    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You need to be on Windows XP Service Pack 3, Windows Vista Service
            Pack 2, Windows 7 Service Pack 1, or Windows 8. 32- or 64-bit
            versions
            are all supported. Windows Rt is not supported.
        </li>
        <li>The Microsoft .Net Framework 4 Client Version is required, but the
            installer should take care of all of that for you.
        </li>
        <!-- <li>It uses ClickOnce, a deployment system that means it updates and installs pre-requisites automatically. This isn't suitable for network installs: if you need an MSI let me know.</li>-->
        <li>It's signed by Claro Software Ltd - thanks for their support.</li>
        <li>If you need help, call me on +44 7983 244 131 or Skype me on
            Alasdairking. You can email support@webbie.org.uk but you're
            unlikely to
            get a response: this isn't my day job!

        </dd>
        <dd>Now uses IE11 rendering.</dd>
        <dd>Made most forms maximised.</dd>
        <dt>4.3.6 23 Feb 2014</dt>
        <dd>Fixed a link text bug, should label links better.</dd>
        <dd>Fixed a focus problem with youtube.com.</dd>

        <dd>Updated updater DLL</dd>
        <dt>4.3.3 7 May 2013</dt>
        <dd>Put in comprehensive error handling. This means that users should
            never see any error messages unless there is a comprehensive Windows
            system crash. Instead, things will just not work or work oddly. This
            is
            to increase confidence for users: ideally they get an error message
            which would help them to fix it, or report it to me to get fixed.
            However, this generally doesn't work as a process.
        </dd>
        <dd>Made "show IE homepage" the default again because of negative
            feedback.
        </dd>
        <dd>Made "localhost" work as URL.</dd>
        <dd>Added support for aria-label and aria-labelledby (found on
            Facebook)
        </dd>
        <dt>4.3.4 7 June 2013 Made about:blank load faster.</dt>
        <dd>Fixed textarea input so it works(!)</dd>
        <dd>Made textarea not label with Name, because that's code and sucks.
        </dd>
        <dd>Made text notruntogether on Facebook.</dd>
        <dt>4.3.5 14 June 2013 Settings now update from one version to the
            next.
        </dt>
        <dd>Defaults to Maximimised window state.</dd>
        <dd>Won't check for updates more than once a day.</dd>

        <dd>Added support for HTML5 input type "range"</dd>
        <dd>Added support for HTML5 "progress" element</dd>
        <dd>Added back in the ability to number links in WebbIE (off by default:
            find it in the Options menu)
        </dd>
        <dd>Bugfixes: fixed uncrop crash, fixed toolbar not hiding/showing,
            improved labelling of controls: many more controls will have working
            labels.
        </dd>
        <dt>4.2.0 17 Feb 2013</dt>
        <dd>Added Favorites window on B (or Ctrl+B) that shows all your
            favourites in a treeview window. There are now three ways to get at
            your
            favourites: the menu, the home page, and the popup window. I like
            the
            last best, but there's no reason to drop the others as yet. I should
            get
            rid of the home page, but someone wrote to say they love it, so I
            don't
            want to!
        </dd>
        <dd>Made Print print the web page, not the text area. This lets you
            print copies of pages like bank details or ticket bookings
            correctly,
            with all the images and layout that people are going to expect to
            see.
        </dd>
        <dd>Now a choice for home page: the IE home page, or the WebbIE home
            page (default)
        </dd>
        <dt>4.1.0 6 Feb 2013</dt>
        <dd>Removed Save Image function, since no-one used it.</dd>
        <dd>Removed the special home page from favourites, since you can't zip
            down it as in a list, and it confused people.
        </dd>
        <dd>Put Ctrl+I to show the web page back in to help people who must view
            the web page for some sites.
        </dd>
        <dd>Removed Launch Internet Explorer since Ctrl+I makes it redundant.
        </dd>
        <dd>Fixed WebbIE 4 shortcut going in "Alasdair King" folder in Start
            menu on Windows XP to 7
        </dd>
        <dt>4.0.11 24 Jan 2013</dt>
        <dd>First shipping release.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Technical notes</h2>

    <p>The WebbIE Web Browser renders web pages as plain text then adds in
        some features to let users search Google, find the content of interest
        on the page and get RSS quickly. </p>

    <p>The idea is that the task profile for screenreader users is similar
        to that of sighted users. That is, it's fast and efficient for users to
        get to the text they want in a page. This means that absolute fidelity
        to every chunk of content on the page takes second place to usefulness.
        For example, images that aren't A element children don't render, whether
        or not the IMG element has an alt tag, because they usually don't add
        any value in terms of information content. Every line that a
        screenreader user must encounter slows them down. The lines that are
        there must all count.</p>

    <p>Internally WebbIE uses the Microsoft WebBrowser control. This gets
        the web content and provides the HTML DOM to WebbIE: WebbIE parses the
        DOM into text. (Actually, it uses both the W3C HTML DOM and the DHTML
        DOM, depending on what needs doing.) </p>

    <p>WebbIE versions up to 3.X were all written in Visual Basic 6, which
        is a wonderfully productive language but dates from 1998 so gradually
        became harder to support. WebbIE 4 is built with VB.Net.</p>
