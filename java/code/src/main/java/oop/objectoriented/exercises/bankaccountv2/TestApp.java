/**
 * We want to model two different bank accounts. They allow deposits, withdrawals, transfers to other accounts and
 * annual interests.
 *
 * BankAccountIntesa has no fees for all the operations, BUT applies no interests, allows transfers within the same
 * country only, and does not allow negative balance.
 *
 * BankAccountUnicredit applies interests, allows transfers to all nations, allows negative balance BUT applies fees
 * for all operations. (1pc for withdrawals, 1pc for deposits, 2pc annual interest)
 *
 * IBAN must have this format: "IT472121100900000002356987411"
 * Country is represented by the first two chars of the IBAN
 *
 * Implement the classes described in UML inside the png file contained in this package.
 * Test them with the following main.
